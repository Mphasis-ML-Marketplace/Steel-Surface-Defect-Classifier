# Steel-Surface-Defect-Classifier
Surface defects in sheet steel poses quality and performance risks. Classifying various defects allows to quickly identify and remove the causes of their occurrence. This Transfer Learning-based solution identifies three classes of surface defects: holes, peels, and others (cracks, scratches, etc.). This solution analyses the input image and provides probability scores for the three defect classes. This can assist metal products manufacturing companies to improve their quality control process. 
# Product Highlights
* This solution identifies three classes of surface defects in sheet steel: holes, peels, and others (cracks, scratches, etc). This solution can assist metal products manufacturing companies to improve their quality control process.
* This solution takes in flat surface images of the sheet steel and uses CNN based model to identify and classify any defects on the surface. This solution can enable high speed and accurate quality check for the processing plant.
* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
